# Design — ithildin-runtime

This doc carries the reasoning. The tracker carries unbuilt scope, and this
doc links to an issue rather than restating it.
[team-charter.md](team-charter.md) carries the roles and the lifecycle, and
the module table this doc reasons about.

## Premise

A trading platform loses three kinds of thing for good, and everything else it
computes can be computed again.

1. **Captured market data.** A quote not recorded when it existed is gone. A
   vendor's history is no substitute, because vendors restate history after
   the fact. The sibling
   [quantitative-trading](https://github.com/l3a0/quantitative-trading)
   repository measured that drift: an adjusted close is a function of the day
   it was downloaded.
2. **The order and fill record.** It is the audit trail, the input that
   calibrates the transaction cost model, and the only way to reconcile what
   the platform thinks it holds against what the broker says it holds. A fill
   nobody journaled cannot be reconstructed from the platform's own state.
3. **Capital.** A strategy can be re-researched. A loss cannot be undone.

A forecast, a backtest, a target portfolio and a report are all regenerable
from those three. That asymmetry is what the ranking rule in
[CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) protects. A path that can lose captured data or the
order record is never deferred, and a path that can lose capital sits behind
the hard limits, which no ranking overrides.

## One runtime

What is tested must be what runs live. A backtester written apart from the
live engine is a second implementation of every strategy it runs, and the two
drift without either looking wrong. Narang names backtest software and data
feed handlers among the places model risk lives (L4616 in the
[highlights](https://github.com/l3a0/trading-strategies/blob/main/research/book-notes/inside-the-black-box.md)).

So the platform has one set of modules, following the boxes in the charter's
module table, and three adapters at its edges.

1. **The data source**, which replays committed history in a backtest and
   reads a live feed on paper and live.
2. **The clock**, which steps through history in a backtest and follows the
   wall clock otherwise.
3. **The broker**, which is a simulator in a backtest and in shadow running, a
   broker's paper account on paper, and the real account only once the owner
   switches it.

The price is that every module has to be written against an event and clock
interface from its first commit, which is slower than a vectorised backtest
over a price array. What it buys is that a strategy's backtest and its paper
run exercise the same lines of code.

## How work is cut and ordered

A slice is the smallest set of deliverables that leaves the product usable by
someone at the end of it. Not a layer, and not a subsystem. A slice that ends
with a component nobody can run is a slice cut the wrong way.

Each slice lives on the tracker as three things.

1. A milestone with the slice's name, so a filed issue has one to take.
2. A parent issue holding what the slice leaves usable and the tests that show
   it works.
3. One sub-issue per deliverable, each with a "blocked by" link to whatever it
   waits on.

Order the slices by what the ranking rule in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)
decides: what is missing from the shortest path to a product someone can use
goes first. Then ship it, use it, and let what breaks set the order after
that. Slice 1 is the walking skeleton, on [#4](https://github.com/l3a0/ithildin-runtime/issues/4). The next slice is chosen
by what breaks while the skeleton runs on paper.

## Vocabulary

Terms with exact definitions, reused on purpose. A term listed here is not a
candidate for a synonym. Anything not listed here follows the writing-style
rule in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md), which prefers deleting an in-group term to
glossing it.

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **vintage** | One series as one source held it on one date, recorded with vendor, symbol, span, that date and which price the series carries, and kept unchanged once written. The term and its rules come from the sibling quantitative-trading repository |
| **target portfolio** | The positions portfolio construction asks for. The difference between it and the current positions is what execution trades |
| **risk gate** | The pre-trade check every order passes on the one order path. It enforces the risk engineer's limits and can refuse an order |
| **journal** | The append-only record of every intent, order, acknowledgment, fill, cancel and human override, written before the action it records |
| **walking skeleton** | A build in which every module exists in its simplest form and the whole loop runs end to end |
| **exploratory** | A result found by looking at the data. It kills an idea or justifies a closer look, and is never a verdict |
| **registered** | A result whose hypothesis was committed in writing before the number was seen. Only a registered result can promote a strategy |

## Configuration

Machine-local config lives under `~/.config/ithildin-runtime/`. Nothing
tracked in this repository carries a secret or a machine-specific path.

No setting exists yet. The first broker or data-vendor credential gets a row
here in the change that first reads it, naming where it lives and what reads
it. A credential lives in the environment of the run or in the machine's
keychain, and never in a file. The table takes the columns Setting, Secret,
Lives in and Read by.

## Considered and rejected

Machinery that was considered and cut, pinned here with the reason. The point
is that a decision stays decided. When something new is cut, add it here in
the same change that cuts it.

Reviews armor what exists and rarely ask whether it should exist, so this
register is also where the answer to "why is this needed" gets written down
once rather than re-argued.

| Cut | Why |
| --- | --- |
| A separate vectorised backtester | It would be a second implementation of every strategy, which the [one runtime](#one-runtime) rule exists to prevent |
| One standing agent per role | Every agent runs on the same model, so a role adds something only as an objective held during one piece of work. Standing agents idle and cost tokens. The charter's `## Why a team needs a charter` gives the reasoning |
| A build-plan doc listing each slice's deliverables and tests | It restated scope the tracker holds, so the two would drift. A slice's tests are its parent issue's acceptance criteria, and its order is the issues' "blocked by" links. The rule for cutting a slice is the one part GitHub cannot hold, and it lives in [How work is cut and ordered](#how-work-is-cut-and-ordered) |
| The template's cross-surface sweep module | The repo has no generated artifact and no figure yet. Take it from [repo-template](https://github.com/l3a0/repo-template) when the first one lands |
